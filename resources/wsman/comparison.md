# SOAP Envelope Comparison: Complete

## Status: All Structural Differences Fixed âœ…

The SOAP envelope structure now matches the successful request. If the server still rejects the request, the issue is likely in the **creationXml content** (the base64-encoded PowerShell remoting initialization data).

## Next Investigation: creationXml Content

The `creationXml` contains serialized PowerShell remoting protocol data that defines:
- Protocol negotiation parameters
- PowerShell version compatibility
- Runspace configuration
- Serialization format

If rejection continues, decode and compare the creationXml content between failed and success requests.
